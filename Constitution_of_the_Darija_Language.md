# Constitution of the Darija Language

## Introduction

This constitution acknowledges that **Darija** is not merely a dialect derived from Arabic, but an **independent Moroccan language** with its own identity. The principles and rules set forth in this constitution reflect our vision for Darija and our direction towards promoting and developing it as a standalone language.

We believe that Darija deserves this recognition due to its pivotal role in the daily lives of Moroccans and its rich diversity, which includes influences from several languages and cultures. This document serves as a basic framework for this vision. We welcome suggestions and ideas that align with this goal and enhance the status of Darija as a Moroccan language, while respecting its diversity across different regions of the Kingdom of Morocco.

### Name of the Moroccan Language

The word **Darija** means "dialect" in Arabic, but here, it refers to the **Moroccan language**. The final name for the Moroccan language will be discussed later, and may evolve to reflect its unique identity.

Darija is the language spoken by Moroccans, including all the different dialects across the Kingdom. Its vocabulary has been influenced by various languages such as French, Amazigh, Arabic, and Spanish.

## Key Actions

- A **database** will be created to catalog Darija expressions and details about them.
- A **platform** will be established to encourage publications in Darija.
- This constitution will be **translated into Darija** in a future version.
- A **Dialects Council** will be formed, representing each dialect of Darija from different regions of Morocco. A regulatory text will define the council’s authority and powers.

## DarijaOrg and Publishing Rules

**DarijaOrg** is a non-profit organization that presents its vision for Darija and is the sole entity authorized to amend this version of the Moroccan Darija constitution.

- **Date of Proposal**: 20/09/2024
- With permission, anyone can copy and modify this project or propose amendments, provided that none of the **non-amendable rules** listed below are violated.

## Non-Amendable Rules

1. **Script**: Darija is written in **Latin letters** from left to right. Specific letters will represent certain sounds, such as:
   - "â" for the **ع** sound
   - "Q" for the **ق** sound
   - Further regulatory texts will define the use of other letters.

2. **Justification for Latin Script**: Most Moroccans already write Darija using Latin letters.

3. **Phonetic Writing**: Darija must be written as Moroccans **pronounce** it in their daily lives, taking into account regional differences and linguistic rules. A framework for writing will be established based on data from all Moroccan regions.

4. **Dialect Diversity**: There is no single standard dialect of Darija. All regional dialects are recognized. In cases of vocabulary overlap, the **Dialects Council** will be consulted.

5. **Exceptions**: Special exceptions may be allowed for regional differences, and a regulatory text will define the criteria for such cases.

6. **Foreign Terms**: If a gap exists for a term in Darija, terms from languages influencing Darija (like French or Spanish) can be used, provided no alternative exists within the language. **Arabic** is to be avoided to prevent its dominance over Darija. Regulatory texts will define the inclusion of foreign terms.

This constitution is a living document, open to future development while maintaining its core principles. **Darija** deserves its recognition as the Moroccan language, and we are committed to its growth and preservation.
